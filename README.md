Developed a machine learning model to classify a place as crowded or non-crowded.
Preprocessed the image dataset by resizing, conversion to grayscale and applying histogram equalization, extracted SIFT
features and applied dimensionality reduction.
Trained the classifiers using classification algorithms like SVM, Random forest, KNN, Decision tree and achieved best
accuracy of 83.38% using SVM
